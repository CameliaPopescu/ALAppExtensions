Hi,

We would need to use the following functions when creating a unit test codeunit in AL:

CreateStandardTextWithExtendedText and CreateCustomer in "Library - Sales"
Enqueue in "Library - Variable Storage"
CreateCBGStatement and CreateCBGStatementLine in "Library - NL Localization"
Please make them external, so we can use them in AL.

Thank you!
